# Kaggle-submissions
This repository contains the my machine learning submissions made on Kaggle.
### Motivation
Data Science has always enticed me since the very beginning of my journey as a Computer Science undergraduate.The incredible power of Python as a
programming language to read, process,manipulate and visualize a humongous amount of data is paramount.Hence, I was also inclined to using Python as a Data Science Language
to visualizing data as well as making predictions by fitting Machine Learning models on training data.
<br>
After doing some courses on Data Science and Machine Learning from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), I wanted to really put my skills
to the test and hence bumped into **Kaggle** after learning about it from a friend.
<br>
### Getting Started on Kaggle
Getting started on Kaggle can be a bit daunting. However, after gaining the basic regression techniques,one should be able to go in for The `Titanic:Machine Learning from Disaster` Competition, the link for which is given below<br>
[Titanic:Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

<br>
### The Dataset
The dataset for the Titanic Competition is divided into 3 files:
- The `gender_submission.csv` file.
- The `train.csv` file.
- The `test.csv` file.
<br>
The `gender_submission.csv` file conatins what the resultant output file needs to look like.
The `train.csv` file conatins the training data whereas the `test.csv` contains the test data.
