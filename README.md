# Kaggle-submissions
This repository contains the my machine learning submissions made on Kaggle.
### Motivation
Data Science has always enticed me since the very beginning of my journey as a Computer Science undergraduate.The incredible power of Python as a
programming language to read, process,manipulate and visualize a humongous amount of data is paramount.Hence, I was also inclined to using Python as a Data Science Language
to visualizing data as well as making predictions by fitting Machine Learning models on training data.
<br>
After doing some courses on Data Science and Machine Learning from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), I wanted to really put muy skills
to the test and hence bumped into **Kaggle** after learning about it from a friend.
